# GraphSAGE-for-Mutagenic-Chemical-Compund-Classification
 This repository explores the use of GraphSAGE, a graph neural network, for classifying mutagenic chemical compounds. The project demonstrates how GraphSAGE can effectively learn from molecular graph representations, providing insights into the potential of graph neural networks for drug discovery and toxicology.
